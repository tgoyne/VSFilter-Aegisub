1) There's a macroblocking problem when seeking with some 1080p h264 videos
   (DXVA and SW mode)
   Sample:  http://www.mediafire.com/?w984256zcsvmu
2) Disable multithreading for x64 build - it's causing a crash with H.264 streams
3) With w32threads instead of pthreads the above crash doesn't happen even with MT enabled,
   but performance is not as good as with pthreads. Using the following sample, the 32bit
   mpc-hc build with pthreads plays smoothly (50fps), but with w32threads the x64 build gets ~40fps.

4) Fix libmingwex.a x64 patch for v2.0 and use that
